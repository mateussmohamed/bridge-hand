# :question: About

A hand may have 13 cards in the bridge, spread across four suits. The four suits are hearts, spades, clubs, and diamonds. The royal cards and aces are worth points during bidding. An Ace is worth four points, a King is worth three points, a Queen is worth two, and a Jack is worth one. Other cards are not worth points (but are used in real bidding to determine the contract).

# :rocket: Features

- Shuffled cards face up in four hands (West, North, East, South)
